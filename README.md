# PictureTTT
### Picture To Text Translator
A cross-platform Xamarin app that extracts text from photos and translates them. This app uses the Microsoft Cognitve Services API and Microsoft Translate Text API.
This app was inspired by the fact that my family members would often come to me to translate english for them, but I am not always around. I thought it would be convenient for them if they could just point their smartphone at english text and be able to read them.
